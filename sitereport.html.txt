<p>  For the basis start of my project and my first-time experience using html were not so pleasant as I do not have a lot of experiences with coding or any form of coding language for that matter. 
So, beginning stages I did run into quite a few problems. One of main issues was that I was having trouble getting my html file to run on the browser. 
It was quote frustrating but after watching some tutorials on how html worked it had turned out that I left the html filed save as a text document instead of an all-files doc. 
Another major issue that I had encounter which had actually put a halt to the development of my webpage for quite a few weeks was the linking tag.
I had researched many other ways in which I could link my htm and CSS file and the most used was the following tag. </p>

<p>  “link ref “stylesheet” href=” file name”</p>

<p> Thanks to the validation website I was able to find a solution to my problem as it turned out that the file name that I had linked and the actual CSS file that I was trying to use did not match up. 
This was quite useful as it taught me to be more careful in the future and to look out for little details such as spelling mistakes and correcting file names and location. I used Validation through my 
project mainly to correct my mistakes as well as cleaning up my site. Finishing touches. </p>
<p> Below is a screen shot of the validation results for my home page. And as you can see the validation site has detected a few errors whilst also advising on a solution. </p>

<p> After overcoming my debacle with linking the html and the CSS file together. Enacting my webpage became pretty much straightforward. I was having more fun with html and CSS as I found that I was memorizing 
the html language as well as the CSS language which I find to be quite repetitive for all the pages added to the site. I focused on creating a basic layout for my site first before moving on to contribute the CSS codes. 
Subsequently I was mainly working on html for the first half of my assignment timeline. </p>

<p> I have included a before and after image of one of my sites. The first image displays my site without the use of CSS language and the finishing results after I had implemented the CSS file into it. </p>

<P> In terms of layout design used on the webpage was inspired by my first webpage which I had done quite a few years back as part of a school project although that did not require any coding language as the 
focus back then was layout, so I had a pretty good base to start from. To achieve the design that I wanted and to enact it as cleanly as possible I had originally planned it out on paper before writing it up on the CSS file. 
The main tags that helped me in achieving this would be. Font size, bacground color </p>

<p> These coding languages were certainly very easy to work with and I had some fun playing around with different choices e.tc. </p>
<p> Overall, I can confidently say that I have a much bigger understanding of how html and CSS files work and how they are implemented towards creating websites every day. Simultaneously, for someone that did not really 
know anything about coding I have also learnt how the coding language works maybe not to the full extent as there is much more to learn but it is most definitely a start. </p>
